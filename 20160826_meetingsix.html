															<h4>Leonhard's Talk: Self-control and inter-temporal choice</h4>
															
															<p>“In both (behavioural) economics and psychology, self-control problems 
															have received much attention. However, the two disciplines' approaches are 
															very different. This presentation reflects on theoretical and experimental 
															differences between economics and psychology, and discusses whether 
															integrating more insights from psychology can be of value to the 
															theoretical and applied economist.”</p>

															<h4>Ruochen talked about "Fairness, altruism and reciprocity"</h4>
															
															<p>“People like to help those who are helping them and to hurt those who are hurting 
															them. It sounds to be different from the traditional view that people care only about 
															their own business. In fact, it has been experimentally verified that people contribute 
															to public goods more than can be explained by pure self interest, and that those free 
															to allocate money choose to sacrifice some to retaliate against unfair treatment 
															rather than grabbing all the money. One case point in which fairness has been studied 
															is monopoly pricing. Some general questions such as what plays an important role in 
															fairness judgement, what is the proper allocation rule, what are different ideas 
															towards altruism and the relation to reciprocity and cooperation will be discussed.”</p>
