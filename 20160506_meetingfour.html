															<h4>Emel's Talk: Measurement of equality of opportunity: A normative approach</h4>
															
															<p>“This paper introduces new measures of inequality of opportunity derived from 
															social welfare functions. Each measure computes the inequality of opportunity in 
															an income distribution by its distance from the fair distribution. The fair income 
															of an individual is determined by his individual characteristics and the conception 
															of fairness adopted. There are two main conceptions of fairness. The first, the 
															principle of compensation, says that inequalities due to characteristics that 
															individuals cannot be held responsible for should be eliminated. The second, 
															the principle of reward, says that there should be an appropriate amount of 
															inequality due to differences in responsibility characteristics.”</p>

															<h4>Matthew's Talk: Effort Signalling in a Supermodular Securitization Game</h4>
															
															<p>“Hitherto, in signalling models of securitization, the value of the underlying 
															asset that is to be signalled is drawn from a probability distribution and is therefore 
															out of the sender’s control.  This paper proposes a model in which an originator 
															explicitly affects the value of the asset through a costly effort choice, which 
															she will subsequently signal via a retention strategy.  It is shown that the imposition 
															of a positive lower bound on an originators choice of retention, akin to the 
															‘Skin in the Game’ rule, both increases signalling costs and, simultaneously,  
															improves incentives for originators, in that it makes a choice of high underwriting 
															effort relatively more likely. Whilst similar results have been obtained in exclusive 
															models of moral hazard or adverse selection, they have not yet been shown to hold 
															in a model that incorporates both aspects of the asymmetric information present 
															in asset securitization.”</p>
