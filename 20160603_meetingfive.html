															<h4>Sering's Talk: Barriers to Efficient Risk Sharing in Village Economies Examined 
															Through The Lens of Heterogeneous 'Social Capital'</h4>
															
															<p>“Risk is an inherent part of the livelihood of rural households in developing 
															countries-climatic and health conditions, loss of property and livestock among 
															others. The absence of insurance (formal or informal) in these communities imply 
															that idiosyncratic shocks affect household consumption and welfare through 
															lower income. Long-term effects of these shocks may result in poverty-traps 
															affecting quality of nutrition and health outcomes; low investments in agriculture 
															and education etc. Strategies used (or developed) to deal with risk 
															(ex-ante and/or ex-poste) have become a huge area of research. Empirical studies 
															on the effectiveness of self-insurance (diversifying economic activities, savings 
															and borrowing) and informal insurance (risk sharing or systems of mutual support) 
															generally report that full-insurance does not occur. Barriers to the effectiveness 
															of the latter which have been cited in the literature include- moral hazard, 
															limited commitment, and (more recently) hidden output/income. An understanding 
															of these barriers including how they constrain the efficiency of risk sharing 
															is crucial for policy. We consider the extent to which barriers to informal 
															risk sharing are sensitive to heterogeneity in social connectedness. To examine 
															this, we use indicators of household social connectedness/visibility which are:
															common-knowledge (such as position in society or parent's position); 
															and private information (such as self-reported social network or investments 
															to preserving social ties) ex-ante and ex-poste to risk sharing agreement.”</p>

															<h4>Seemanti talked about 'Breaking Belief': Mitigating the impact of adversity before 
															the impact stabilizes</h4>
															
															<p>“If we believe that success exhaustively depends on two factors, precisely luck 
															(which constitutes all external factors that is not in our control) and our own effort,
															the only way to maximize the probability of success is by maximising our effort 
															since external factors are out of our control. For the ones stuck in poverty trap 
															this holds a larger merit since they are externally constrained and the probability 
															of success that can be attributed to 'luck' is barely minimal. Also, considering the 
															marginal benefit of effort is going to be lower for the poor, higher effort is 
															required from their side to maximize the probability of success. Such is the
															significance of effort chosen by the poor. Much light has been thrown upon how the 
															experience of adversity restricts the cognitive ability or attention allocation 
															ability of the people trapped in chronic poverty. However, these and many more such
															attributes may only reduce the ability of the poor to give effort. How about the 
															willingness to persistently give effort? How does the experience of adversity 
															impact the choice of effort? Is there any channel that could be intervened to
															mitigate this impact of adversity? This paper is an attempt to throw some light 
															on these questions.”</p>
