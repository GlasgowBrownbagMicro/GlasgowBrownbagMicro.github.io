											<h3>Summary</h3>
											<p>The topics of the presentations by Chizoba and Putthi 
											spanned a wide range, reaching from sovereign debt negotiations
											to disease mitigation.</p>
								
											<h4>Chizoba's Talk: Beliefs in Sovereign Debt Restructuring</h4>
											<p>“My research investigates the impact of heterogeneous beliefs on delays in 
											sovereign debt restructuring negotiations. As there is no agreed internationally 
											recognised framework for resolving a sovereign debt crisis, the two bargaining 
											parties (creditor(s) and the sovereign debtor) could both perceive and predict 
											the negotiation process from conflicting perspectives, consequently leading to 
											costly delays. I will be presenting some evidence on court enforcement of 
											sovereign debt governed by foreign law, with a particular focus on Argentina, 
											highlighting episodes where heterogenous beliefs may have arisen.”</p>
											
											<h4>Putthi's Talk: Attention Allocation and Mitigation of Disease</h4>
											<p>“Rabies is a deadly disease that can infect human through contacts with 
											infected mammals, especially domestic dogs. Even though, preventative methods are 
											well understood and most developed countries have successfully eliminated rabies; 
											the disease is still rampant in many developing countries. One of the reasons 
											for this is the lack of participation from the local communities. The main 
											hypothesis of my work is that because the poor are occupied by their daily chores 
											and obligations, not enough attention is being paid to health related problems. 
											In this talk, I set up the conceptual framework on which my model is based.”</p>
